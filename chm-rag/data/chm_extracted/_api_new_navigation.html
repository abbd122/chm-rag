<div class="textblock"><p >The Api uses the navigation The new version of ZW 3 D API has upgraded and supplemented the relevant functions on the basis of the old interface. In principle, the functions of the old interface will not be changed and maintained. You can quickly retrieve the corresponding new interface by adding the old interface with discarded marks. Compared with the old interface, the new interface is more complete and standardized in function and use. Here we introduce the features of the new interface, whether you are a new ZW3DAPI user or an old user, you can quickly understand these new features through this article before using the new interface. Different from the old interface, the new interface is divided according to the way of interface objects, standardizes and unifies the relevant words according to the platform functions, and reduces the use of abbreviations as much as possible. You can complete rapid retrieval through the required functions, environment and related interfaces. The new interface regards part as the default environment, including features, can be used in parts and assembly environment. The et metal environment can be regarded as a special part environment, which is common in many cases. <br  />
 The new interface starts with "Zw", and no longer uses the "cvx" of the old interface. You can quickly distinguish between the old and the new interfaces through the prefix. The enumeration and structures used by the new interface start with "ezw" and "szw", respectively, which are also distinguished from the "evx" and "svx" of the old interface. <br  />
 The name of the new interface adopts the way of big hump, that is, follow "Zw" + "environment (according to requirements)" + "object" + "function". In general, "environment" + "object" can help you complete the distinction of modules, and here introduce the main modules in the new interface and the functions of the corresponding interface. <br  />
 The Basic module is the universal module of ZW3D, where you can complete the management of the platform and some global variables. In addition, the module also includes some general functions. <br  />
 File module is the management of ZW3D file hierarchy, mainly including file processing, root object processing (used under ZW3D multiple root files), file path management, etc. You can complete the opening and saving of relevant files through the interface under this module. <br  />
 Entity Module is a general interface, including parts, shapes, wireframes, components and other objects can be collectively known as Entity, this part of the interface has a high degree of generalization. <br  />
 The interface of Brep module is mainly a topological level interface, which can be divided into shape, face, loop, preedge, and edge. Related interfaces support the search between different objects. Through these interfaces, you can complete the topology management of different objects. <br  />
 WireFrame Is a wireframe, mainly including curve and point two major objects. The objects of this module can be divided into actual points, lines and virtual points and lines, but in essence, the two are equivalent. <br  />
 History Is mainly some operation of the historical tree, can be obtained on the historical tree objects including benchmarks and features, that is, you can obtain the history of the current model tree through this part of the interface, later will open more direct interfaces to the historical tree management. <br  />
 Datum is the benchmark module, where you can create and manage the benchmark to facilitate your positioning of the model. <br  />
 The Feature module is relatively special, which mainly includes Shape, Free Form and Wireframe, corresponding to the basic modeling module of the platform. You can quickly compare with the relevant interfaces through the functions of the platform. It should be noted that some other interfaces including the sheet metal modules may also create features in the history tree, and their modules are independent. <br  />
 Attribute Mainly refers to the management interface of files and object attributes. It should be noted that the display class attributes of objects are not in this module, and they will be placed in the same module with their own objects. <br  />
 Equation Is a related interface for variable management. You can obtain and set file related variables for this part of the interface. The interface of this module is mainly used to manage parametric models, and is often used in combination with the interface of Attribute. <br  />
 Parameter For other parametric management interfaces, mainly including ConfigTable, where you can complete different parametric settings in a single file. <br  />
 Math module is mainly the related interface of mathematical operation, including matrix, vector, including box and other mathematical objects. We provide some interfaces to help you quickly make matrix changes. <br  />
 DataExchange Is the interface module of data interaction class, mainly including import and export class interfaces, as well as some related management interfaces. <br  />
 The View interface is the management interface of the view perspective, mainly the perspective switch of the display class. It should be noted that you need to distinguish it from the view in the drawing. <br  />
 PMI is the marking interface in the parts and derivative environment. <br  />
 Assembly Is a special interface for the assembly environment, which generally needs to be used in the activated assembly environment, mainly including assembly, components, and constraints. You can use such an interface to complete the assembly of the components and the addition of constraints. <br  />
 Drawing Is a special interface for the engineering drawing, which generally needs to be used in the activated engineering drawing, mainly including sketch, 3D sketch, constraint, annotation and other sub-modules. You can identify such interface through the module name. <br  />
 Sketch Is a special interface for sketches, mainly including the drawing of some two-dimensional lines and the addition of constraints. What is necessary to distinguish is that some special interfaces are needed in these special environments, and some general class interfaces may not adapt to the environment. <br  />
 In order to facilitate your use, in addition to some matching query interfaces in the special object module, we provide a special query class module Inquire, this part of the interface is often more versatile, you can quickly retrieve the matching query interface according to the actual requirements. <br  />
The Ui module is a related interface for display and user interaction. In addition to the management and editing of Ui, you can also call to the interaction-related functions. </p>
